# Elevvo Internship Projects

This repository contains the three main tasks I completed during my Elevvo internship.

## ðŸ”¹ Tasks

### 1. Student Score Prediction
- Built a predictive model to forecast student performance.
- Used **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** models.
- Implemented data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.

### 2. Loan Approval Prediction
- Developed a binary classification model to predict loan approvals.
- Used **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree** models, and enhanced the model using **SMOTE** balncing technique.
- Performed feature engineering, training, cross-validation, and evaluation.
- Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.

### 3. Traffic Sign Recognition
- Implemented a computer vision model for detecting and classifying traffic signs.
- Used **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.
- Tools: Python, OpenCV, deep learning libraries.
